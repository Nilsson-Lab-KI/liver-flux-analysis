# Model-based flux analysis of human liver slices

This repository contains code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper "Global 13C tracing and metabolic flux analysis
of intact human liver tissue ex vivo" by Grankvist & JÃ¶nsson, et al. To run this code, you will need the [mathcompbio](https://github.com/Nilsson-Lab-KI/mathcompbio) package
and a license for GAMS with the CONOPT solver.
